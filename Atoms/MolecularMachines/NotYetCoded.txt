Hydrophobicity
Chemical Complementarity
	Forming hydrogen bonds
	I’d rather feel no hydrogen between my feet…if I could I surely would. BIRD!
Nucleic Acids —> molecule chains of nucleotides (4)
Proteins —> molecule chains of amino acids (20) —> much more variety. Alphabet —> Language
	Water behavior (twist, bend to find optimal shape to have charged (Hydrophilic) amino acids on surface
	Rules for folding —> Design own proteins
	Perform most jobs in cell, except very few specialized task that get outsource to N. Acids, Lipids and carbohydrates.

Information transfer
	Binding of Messenger RNA to Transfer RNA is when genetic information gets translated (bound) in a sequence of amino acids in a protein.
